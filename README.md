# NextJS with TypeScript

This is a simple template for a NextJS with TypeScript project. It provides you or your team the following...

 - eslint check and enforcement (as unopinionated as is reasonable)
 - tsc type-checks
 - jest unit tests with @testing-library/react
 - husky with pre-commit and pre-push hooks
 - test coverage and 80% thresholds

 ## How To

 Simply clone this repo and run the following at your command line...

 ```
 git remote rm origin
 git remote add origin <your repo url>
 git push origin <your branch name> --force
 ```
